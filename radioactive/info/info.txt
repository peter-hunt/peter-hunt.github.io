Rules & Policies


By choosing to join the RΛDIOACTIVE Chatroom, you agree to follow rules listed within this text. If you find a member in this chatroom who is breaking one of these rules, please report them to the current admin.


1) Spamming is disallowed

What do we mean by spamming?

Spamming is the action of flooding the chat with unwanted content.

This includes:
 - Annoying others with random or repeating content while they are chatting.
 - Sending long texts that flush the previous content.
 - Keep sending content that makes someone unhappy or angry.


2) Sensitive content is avoided

What do we mean by sensitive content?

Sensitive content is the type of content that can put other members in risk or embarrass them.
Some sensitive information is allowed only if the information you send is targeted, acceptable to the recipient, and everyone can treat your information rationally.

This includes:
 - Pornography or violent content.
 - Sensitive personal information about others.
 - Offensive political content.


3) The admin is chosen from elections held every week

What does the admin do?

The admin not only supervises the chatroom, but also is responsible for the chatroom. This doesn't mean you can do bad things and put the blame on the admin, who can punish the member if the responsibility is with the member.

Why are we doing this?

The right and costs of this chatroom are equally distributed to all the members. The cost may be heavy for a person, and the administration should be given to the person who's agreed to be the most suitable for the admin from elections


4) Contract the admin if you think there's anything wrong with or missing in the rules

Rules should always be changing, because old rules may turn out to be bad, and new rules may be needed over time.


5) If you break any rules, the admin shall punish you

The punishment is decided by how badly the member behaved.

Punishments may include:
 - Being banned from the chatroom for some time.
 - Not being able to be the admin or being able to take part in the election.

And the punishment can be shortened or disabled right away if the member truly feel bad of what he/she did and behaved well during the punishment.
